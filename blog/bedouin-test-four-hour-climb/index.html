Only Four Hours."</p> <div class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-75">By Ali • February 1, 2025</div> </div> </section> <article class="py-16 md:py-20" style="background-color: #f5e6d3;"> <div class="container max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6"> <div class="bg-white p-8 md:p-12 rounded-2xl shadow-xl"> <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none"> <p class="text-xl text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
In 1984, when Tony Howard's team arrived in Wadi Rum, the Bedouin had a test for them. It's a test we still use today-not to be cruel, but to teach an important lesson about respect, humility, and the true nature of these mountains.
</p> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Setup</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Tony's team had been shown various approach canyons where Bedouin hunting routes went to the mountaintops, including Jebel Rum. Then Defallah pointed out a huge cave, high in the east face.
</p> <div class="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-600 p-6 my-8 rounded"> <p class="text-stone-700 italic text-lg mb-3">
"You can go there to the top. It's easy. It will only take you four hours. You won't need your ropes."
</p> <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">- Defallah Atieq to Tony Howard's team, 1984</p> </div> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Tony wrote: "Well, it didn't look that easy, but we were yet to learn that they had a climber's sense of humour."
</p> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Reality</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The team decided to take one rope between the four of them, "just in case." They were not surprised when the initial pitch turned out to be a VS (Very Severe) crack-not exactly "easy."
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">Into the Maze</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
As they climbed higher, they became lost in an immense canyon-actually the eastern end of the Great Siq, though they didn't know it at the time. They continued up through steep, exposed, and sometimes-overhanging cracks and chimneys.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Tony marveled at "the Bedouin's ability to climb alone with only a rifle for company in such wild and exposed surroundings. Plus, if they were lucky, they would be climbing back down with an ibex on their back."
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The team was happy to have a rope and wished they had two, which would have speeded up the climb.
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Unique Architecture</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Eventually they climbed through a cavernous hole-initially high and wide, tapering down to body width with a thirty-meter roof. Tony described it as "a truly unique piece of rock architecture."
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
With time lost in route-finding, the supposed four hours was well gone when they emerged onto... not the summit. They couldn't even see it. They were simply at the top of the east face, directly above their camp.
</p> <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8 rounded"> <p class="text-stone-700"> <strong>The Realization:</strong> For the Bedouin, "the top" was simply the high plateau, home to the ibex. The actual highest point wasn't relevant to them-they were hunting, not peak-bagging.
</p> </div> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Great Siq Challenge</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Behind them was what they called the East Dome. They soloed up to its top, from where the true summit could be seen-but still a kilometer away. They were short on time but decided to go for it.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
They were soon stopped in their tracks. The siq they had crossed on their ascent actually cut deep into the plateau-thirty meters wide and deep with vertical walls. No chance with their single rope.
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Mysterious Log Bridge</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Hammad Hamdan had told them the siq narrowed and there was a log across it that ibex used. "There were even dead ibex in the bottom, below the log," he said.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
They found human footprints going to the edge, but couldn't find the log or the narrows. Tony wrote: "In fact, we have never found either. Was it a Bedouin wind-up?"
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
(To this day, climbers debate whether the log bridge exists. Some say they've found it. Others think it's a Bedouin joke that's lasted forty years!)
</p> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Unplanned Bivouac</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
By then they knew they weren't going to get back down that day. They hurried back over the East Dome, downclimbing their ascent route. It was slow progress.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
An impromptu bivouac was inevitable, with:
</p> <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6"> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">No water left</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">No bivvy gear</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">No wood for a fire</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">A long, cold night ahead</span> </li> </ul> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Welcome Committee</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
They arrived back at camp early the following morning with throats parched, much to the amusement of the Bedouin. A bunch of them were waiting: Defallah and his brothers, plus Hammad and Muhammad Musa.
</p> <div class="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-600 p-6 my-8 rounded"> <p class="text-stone-700 italic text-lg mb-3">
"Where have you been?"
</p> <p class="text-sm text-stone-600 mb-4">- The Bedouin, grinning</p> <p class="text-stone-700">
Tony's response: "Round one to them! But actually, they were right; once you know the way, four hours is possible, but there are few others who would climb and descend this complex 400-meter VS without ropes."
</p> </div> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Lesson</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
This wasn't cruelty-it was education. The Bedouin were teaching several important lessons:
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Respect the Mountains</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
What looks "easy" from below can be complex and serious. The mountains demand respect, preparation, and humility.
</p> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. Understand the Difference</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The Bedouin could do this route in four hours, solo, without ropes. But they had:
</p> <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6"> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">Intimate knowledge of every hold and feature</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">Years of experience on this specific route</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">Knowledge passed down through generations</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start"> <span class="text-orange-600 mr-3">•</span> <span class="text-stone-700">A lifetime of climbing barefoot on this rock</span> </li> </ul> <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-4">3. Learn to Listen</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The test showed Tony's team that they needed the Bedouin. Not just for directions, but for the deep, internalized knowledge that can't be written in a guidebook.
</p> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Climber's Sense of Humor</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Tony wrote that the Bedouin had "a climber's pride in their routes; they pointed us towards them, giving only enough information to get us started, and were there to meet us on our return, grinning mischievously if we had been lost in the bizarre maze of these sandstone mountains."
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
He added: "We liked their climber's sense of humour."
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
This wasn't mean-spirited. It was the way climbers everywhere test each other-with challenges that teach respect and build camaraderie. The Bedouin were saying: "You want to climb our mountains? Prove you're serious. Prove you can handle it. Then we'll be friends."
</p> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">We Still Do This Today</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I'll be honest: we still test climbers sometimes. Not to be cruel, but to teach the same lessons. When someone arrives acting overconfident, talking about how they've climbed everywhere and know everything, we might suggest a "simple" route.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Usually, they come back humbled and respectful. And that's when the real partnership begins.
</p> <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8 rounded"> <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-stone-800 mb-3">Climb with Humility</h3> <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
When you climb with me, I won't test you like this-unless you really need it! But I will share the same knowledge that my ancestors shared with Tony Howard. Come with respect and humility, and you'll learn things that can't be found in any guidebook.

Book Your Adventure
</a> </div> <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Aftermath</h2> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
After this experience, Tony's team approached every route with more respect. They listened more carefully to the Bedouin's advice. They prepared for longer days than expected. They brought bivvy gear "just in case."
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Most importantly, they learned to "think like Bedouin hunters, who have learned to think like ibex." This deep understanding is what unlocked the mountains for them.
</p> <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">
The test worked. Tony and his team passed. And the partnership that began with that humbling experience lasted for decades and continues to this day.
